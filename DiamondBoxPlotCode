# This code uses R to create a box plot of diamond price based on color and then sets the appropriate cartisian parameters to best view the data. 
#Create boxplo from the "Diamonds" data set part of the ggplot package in R that compares color and price

      color = color, geom = 'boxplot', 
#Names the graph and axis      
      main = "Boxplot of Diamond Prices by Color", xlab = "Color of Diamond", ylab = "Price of Diamond ($)"
      )+
#Sets the cartisian coordinates to best demonstrate the relationship
